# Graph-Algorithm
Consider an undirected graph consisting of n nodes where each node is labeled from to and the edge between any two nodes is always of length 6. We define node s to be the starting position for a BFS.

Given q queries in the form of a graph and some starting node,s, perform each query by calculating the shortest distance from starting node to all the other nodes in the graph. Then print a single line of n-1 space-separated integers listing node s's shortest distance to each of the n-1 other nodes (ordered sequentially by node number); if s is disconnected from a node, print -1 as the distance to that node.
